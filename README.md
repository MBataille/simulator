# simulator
Interactive PDE and ODE simulation program. 

## Installation

Download or clone repo and locate in your folder of preference. 
Then all you have to do is to run the 'sim.py' file.

If you want to add more equations to simulate, create an 'eq_name.py' file in the equations folder (where eq_name
is the name of the equation), import it in the 'allequations.py' file and add it to the ALL_EQUATIONS_LIST. You can
look at eqntest.py for an example. 

Note: It is recommended that you have anaconda installed.
